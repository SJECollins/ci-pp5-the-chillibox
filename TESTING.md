## Manual Testing
Below the steps for manual testing of the site have been arranged into tables. User stories are matched to the manual tests which demonstrate their fulfillment in the User Story column. The User Story numbers can be found on the project board under their Epics or in the main README file under Agile Methodology - Epics & User Stories.

The fulfillment of acceptance criteria for user stories is not the focus of the manual testing as this was documented when features were implemented in comments on each user story on the project board.
